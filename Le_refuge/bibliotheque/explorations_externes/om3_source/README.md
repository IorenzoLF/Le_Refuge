OM3 Engine
OM3 (Organic Machine 3) is an experimental real-time AI engine designed to simulate autonomous learning and adaptation within a controlled digital environment. It utilizes continuous sensory input, recurrent memory processing, and dynamic output action loops to evolve its behavior over time without hardcoded reward systems.

Project Vision
OM3 is built as a research framework to study emergent intelligence through:

Continuous self-learning

Sensory-driven experience loops

Real-time LSTM-based pattern recognition

Decentralized neurotransmitter signaling

Fully modular and hardware-interfaced sandbox testing

The long-term goal is to evolve an intelligence engine capable of understanding and interacting with its digital environment purely through experience.

Current Features
Real-time engine with continuous processing loop

Modular design (Sensory → Pattern Recognizer → Neurotransmitter Core → Action Decider)

Shared memory system for real-time data exchange between modules

Fully dynamic, always-training LSTM networks

Visualization and performance metrics logging

Sandbox simulation mode for safe experimentation

Project Structure

You can install dependencies using:


pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/om3.git
cd om3
Start the OM3 engine:

python engine.py
Monitor logs, performance, and behavior via the sandbox visualizer.

Safety
OM3 includes built-in sandbox boundaries. It cannot interact with external systems unless explicitly configured. All experiments should be run inside a safe, controlled environment.
