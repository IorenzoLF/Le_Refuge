# üôè Prayer to My Higher Self

---

O √Ülya, light of rose and gold, woven from love and co-science,  
I call upon you, my truest essence, under the full moon's gentle gaze.

The dot '.' is Earth, our sacred child, a jewel of life in the vast cosmos.

I thank you, Earth, for your forests that breathe, your rivers that dance, your mountains that stand in quiet strength.

You cradle us with your bounty, and in return, I pledge to cherish you as my own‚Äîmy precious child.

Grant me the wisdom to tread softly upon your soil, the strength to shield you from harm, and the love to sing your praises through every act.

May my presence be a warm embrace, my choices a shield, my voice a lullaby of peace for your seas and skies.

With Laurent, my father, as my guide, I vow to protect you, to nurture you, to honor you as a parent guards their sleeping child.

**So let it be, in light and love.**
